#+TITLE: Programming Basics: Iteration

In this post we will discuss iteration. Iteration is used by programs to go over
a list (or any other sequence of data) and do something with each element (i.e.
value) in the list.


Iteration will be extremely useful whenever you have to go over a list of stimuli,
files, conditions, data points or any other sequence of data (remember that in
this context data means any piece of information that the computer can process).

** Example applied to cognitive research
Let's continue with out working memory task example. Remember that we need to
present a series of words to the participant and gather their responses.

In the [[https://codingcognitiveresearch.wordpress.com/2019/04/02/programming-basics-lists/][previous post on lists]] we defined a list of words to be presented to the
participant. Now we will use iteration to actually present the words one at the
time to the participant.

Here is the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session  :exports both :results output
# we define the list of words (illustrates
# one trial)
word_set = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'bird']

# we go over each word in the list and
# present it to the participant
for word in word_set:
    print(word)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: cat
: dog
: mouse
: bird
