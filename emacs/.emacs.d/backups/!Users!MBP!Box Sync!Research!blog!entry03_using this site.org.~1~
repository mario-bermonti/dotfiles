#+TITLE: A note about using this website

* Outline :noexport:
	•  Write it
	• Change code (experiment)
	• Difficulty with concepts or examples from other disciplines
		○ If you feel lost with external resources, make suggestions about writing basics
	• Python will be used, python 3 recommended

* Getting the most of this site
A few notes are in order about how to use this blog:
- You should write the code yourself in your computer and tested. I just can’t
  emphasize it enough. It’s essential to getting the hang of it and practicing.


- You should play with the code changing specific parts of it (one at the time)
  at testing how the results change. It’s really useful for understanding the
  code and concepts.


- It is completely normal, although frustrating, to experience difficulty
  understanding specific concepts. Sometimes its because the examples
  used are from disciplines like computer science and math. I tried identifying
  resources that don’t use examples too alien to behavioral and cognitive sciences
  but if you feel lost with the external resources I include, tell me in the
  comments and I will consider writing the posts myself.


- We will use the Python programming language. Although there are a lot of
  great programming languages, Python is awesome because of its simple syntax
  and support for research and open source science. I recommend using Python
  version 3, it’s the one I use and it’s great. Although version 2 is great
  and still used extensively.
