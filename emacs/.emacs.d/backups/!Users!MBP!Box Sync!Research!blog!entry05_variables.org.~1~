#+TITLE: Programming Basics: Variables

In this post we will discuss Variables and how they are used in programming.


Variables are the fundamental building blocks of any software so it's important
you have a good understanding of them.


You can think of them as a place in memory where you can store data.

** Example applied to cognition research
Imagine you design an experiment to test working memory. You will need to store
the ID for each participant in order to identify their data. In python, you can
easily create a variable called "id" and store the ID typed into the program
by the person administering the working memory task until the experiment ends
and the ID is needed to identify the data.

Here is the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session  :exports code :results output
  id = input("Write the participant's ID: ")
  # the input(...) part asks the user for their ID. You can ignore that part for now

  #########################################
  # Here goes the code for the experiment #
  #########################################

  print("Participant's data:", id)
  # This code just shows the contents of the id variable in the console
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[3]:
# output

    700             )
    701         return self._input_request(str(prompt),
