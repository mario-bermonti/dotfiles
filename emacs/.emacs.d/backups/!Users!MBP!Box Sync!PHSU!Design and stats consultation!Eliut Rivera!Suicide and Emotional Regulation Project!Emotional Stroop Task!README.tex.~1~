\maketitle
This is a Spanish Emotional Stroop task (EST) developed for a research project
conducted in the neurocognitive laboratory at Ponce Health Sciences University.
This project compares people with a history of suicidal behavior vs a control
group (non-clinical population) on this and other tasks.

The EST was developed using Psychopy 3 (citation) builder but includes code
components. It can't be run with Psychopy 2 because it uses Unicode
characters (i.e., words with accents) and Psychopy crashes with this sort of
stimuli or doesn't display it correctly. It includes practice and experiment trials.

The EST was translated from the extended Stroop task (includes
instructions and practice trials) found in the demos that Psychopy provides. The
materials were translated and the trial document (csv file) was adapted.

\section*{Practice trials}
\label{sec:orgheadline2}
The EST includes 24 practice trials consisting of congruent word and colors.
The words presented are azul, rojo, and verde (i.e., Spanish words for
blue, red, and green) and are presented in colors blue, red, and green.
Participants respond by pressing:
\begin{itemize}
\item f for red
\item j for green
\item "space bar" for blue
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Practice trial's structure:}
\label{sec:orgheadline1}
\begin{itemize}
\item instructions
\item fixation cross for .5 sec
\item blank screen for .5 sec
\item the word is presented until a response is made
\item participant makes a response with the keyboard (f, j, space bar)
\item the participant receive feedback
\end{itemize}


Practice trials are organized into blocks of 6 words (two of each color) and
blocks are presented randomly.

\section*{Experimental trials}
\label{sec:orgheadline5}
There are 48 words from each valence (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral)
for a total of 144 words. Each word is presented only once.

\subsection*{Experimental trial's structure:}
\label{sec:orgheadline3}
\begin{itemize}
\item instructions
\item fixation cross for .5 sec
\item blank screen for .5 sec
\item word is presented until response is made
\item participant makes repines with the keyboard (f, j, space bar)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Technical details about blocks:}
\label{sec:orgheadline4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Trials (stimuli) are organized into blocks to get semi-randomization:
\begin{itemize}
\item 16 blocks
\item Each block has 9 trials: 3 words from each valence, with 1 word for
each valence - color combination
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The following table represents one block.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
text & letterColor & corrAns & condition\\
\hline
positive1 & blue & j & positive\\
negative1 & blue & j & negative\\
neutral1 & blue & j & neutral\\
positive2 & green & space & positive\\
negative2 & green & space & negative\\
neutral2 & green & space & neutral\\
positive3 & red & f & positive\\
negative3 & red & f & negative\\
neutral3 & red & f & neutral\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item These blocks for randomization are organized into 4 large experimental
blocks of 36 trials each.
\item Participants are allowed 3 breaks to rest (one rest after completing every 36
trials. The participant continues by pressing a key.
\item Conditions are balanced in terms of word length
\end{itemize}
