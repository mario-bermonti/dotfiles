* Why learn coding?
Learning to code may seem really challenging but it's just a matter of dedicating time to learn
another very useful tool.


A few reasons why learning to code is a good idea:
- *Stimuli preparation:*
    Coding is really helpful for creating stimuli, cleaning stimuli based on certain criteria,
    and organizing it (e.g., analyzing word length to balance that it across conditions).


- *Experiments design:*
    Even though most stimuli presentation software have graphical interfaces,
    most of them also provide a coding interface that give you unlimited power to customize
    experimental paradigms.


- *Automatizing data management:*
    Can help automatize the retrieval and merging of databases, but also changing its format so
    that it may be analyzed by specific software or stored in a specific format.


- *Analyzing data:*
    It can be a really flexible tool for graphing and tabulating data, and also for conducting
    statistical analysis (e.g. descriptive and inferential statistics), especially with
    large databases. It has the added benefit of being able to replicate the analysis
    in a matter of seconds, which makes it a treat for data analysis.


- *Reproducible research:*
    Programming is especially useful for reproducible research and improving open science because
    it offers very useful tools for developing research protocols and documenting all
    research phases. For example, this post is written or [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html][org-mode]] (i.e. a specific mode available
    on the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] text editor) and this tools lets you write text and include source code that can be run
    from within Emacs and it captures whatever the code outputs. This is really useful for conducting
    statistical analysis and integrating code, results, descriptions of the results, and much more.


Now, if this isn't enough, be sure to checkout some of the posts about using coding to solve common tasks
in cognitive research! For example [[http://www.djmannion.net/psych_programming/introduction.html#why-is-programming-useful-to-learn-as-a-psychology-student][this one blog about using programming for perception/vision science]].
