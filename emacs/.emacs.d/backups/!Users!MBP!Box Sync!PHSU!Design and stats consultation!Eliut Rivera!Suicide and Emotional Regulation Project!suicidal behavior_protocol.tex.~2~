\maketitle
This is a Spanish Emotional Stroop task (EST) developed for a research project
conducted in the neurocognitive laboratory at Ponce Health Sciences University.
This project compares people with a history of suicidal behavior vs a control
group (non-clinical population) on this and other tasks.

The EST was developed using Psychopy 3 (citation) builder but includes code
components. It can't be run with Psychopy 2 because it uses unicode
characters (i.e., words with accents) and Psychopy crashes with this sort of
stimuli or doesn't display it correctly. It includes practice and experiment trials.

\section*{Practice trials}
\label{sec:orgheadline1}
The EST includes 24 practice trials consisting of congruent word and colors.
The words presented are azul, rojo, and verde (i.e., Spanish words for
blue, red, and green) and the participants respond by pressing:
\begin{itemize}
\item f for red
\item j for green
\item "space bar" for blue
\end{itemize}

The practice trials consist of:
\begin{itemize}
\item instructions
\item fixation cross for .5 sec
\item blank screen for .5 sec
\item the word is presented until a response is made
\item participant makes a reponse with the keyboard (f, j, space bar)
\item the participant receives feedback
\end{itemize}

\section*{Experimental trials}
\label{sec:orgheadline3}
There are 48 words from each valence (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral)
for a total of 144 words. Each word is presented only once.

The experimental trials consist of:
\begin{itemize}
\item instructions
\item fixation cross for .5 sec
\item blank screen for .5 sec
\item word is presented until response is made
\item participant makes reponse with the keyboard (f, j, space bar)
\end{itemize}

Participants are allowed to rest after 36, 72, and 108 trials. This can be
easily modified to suit your needs.

\subsection*{Technical details about blocks:}
\label{sec:orgheadline2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Trials are organized into blocks to get semi-randomization:
\begin{itemize}
\item 16 blocks
\item Each block has 9 trials: 3 words from each valence, with 1 word for
each valence - color combination
\end{itemize}
\item Conditions are balanced in terms of word length
\end{itemize}

The following table represents one block.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
text & letterColor & corrAns & condition\\
\hline
positive1 & blue & space & positive\\
negative1 & blue & space & negative\\
neutral1 & blue & space & neutral\\
positive2 & green & j & positive\\
negative2 & green & j & negative\\
neutral2 & green & j & neutral\\
positive3 & red & f & positive\\
negative3 & red & f & negative\\
neutral3 & red & f & neutral\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section*{Technical details about blocks:}
\label{sec:orgheadline4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Trials (stimuli) are organized into blocks to get semi-randomization:
\begin{itemize}
\item 16 blocks
\item Each block has 9 trials: 3 words from each valence, with 1 word for
each valence - color combination

The following table represents one block.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
text & letterColor & corrAns & condition\\
\hline
positiva1 & blue & j & positive\\
negativa1 & blue & j & negative\\
neutral1 & blue & j & neutral\\
positiva2 & green & space & positive\\

neutral2 & green & space & neutral\\
positiva3 & red & f & positive\\
negativa3 & red & f & negative\\
neutral3 & red & f & neutral\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item These blocks for randomization are organized into 3 large experimental
blocks
\item Participants are allowed 3 breaks to rest. One after completing every 36
trials (4 pseudo-randomization blocks). The participant continued by
pressing a key.
\item Conditions balanced in terms of word length
\end{itemize}
