#+title: Programming Basics: Working with files

In this post we will discuss how to read files stored in your
computer (i.e., input/output).

 This skill is really important because it will give our programs the ability to
read datasets, stimulus banks or any other file we choose and use its contents.

** Cognitive research example
Even though the method explained in the video is commonly used for reading files,
in cognitive research you most probably are going to be reading and writing
data that is organized in tabular form (e.g., Excel). To read this kind of data
it is much easier and common to use the [[https://pandas.pydata.org/][pandas]] package. This package
provides methods to read Excel or CSV files (and many other file types).

Read Excel files:
#+begin_src python :exports both :session :results latex
  # we need to specify that we will use pandas
  # in our script
  # the "as pd" part simply renames pandas
  # to pd, which is the convention
  import pandas as pd

  # reads the stimuli in the file excel file
  # be sure to include the 'xlsx'
  # part (i.e., file extension)
  stimuli = pd.read_excel('stimuli.xlsx')

  # let's see the content
  stimuli.to_latex()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
{} & word 1 &    word2 & word 3 \\
\midrule
0 &    cat &      dog &  mouse \\
1 &   fish &  lobster &  whale \\
2 &  eagle &   falcon &    bat \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
#+END_LaTeX
