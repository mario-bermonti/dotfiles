#+TITLE: Programming Basics: Iteration

In this post we will discuss iteration. Iteration is used by programs to go over
a list (or any other sequence of data) and do something with each element (i.e.
value) in the list.


Iteration will be extremely useful whenever you have to go over a list of stimulus,
files, conditions, data points or any other sequence of data (remember that in
this context data means any piece of information that the computer can process).
