#+DESCRIPTION: Discussion about lists
#+TITLE: Programming Basics: Lists

In this post we will discuss lists and how they can be used to make our programs
do more sophisticated things.  You can think of lists as variables that can hold
many values at the same time and lets you access them individually.

** Example applied to cognitive research
Imagine you design an experiment to test working memory. You will need to
present a series of words to the participant and gather their responses.

So lets build a single trial to simplify things. In each trial you will need
a set of words to present to the participant and then let them type in the words
they just saw. We could very easily store all the words for a trial (set of words)
in a list.

Here is the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :exports both :results output
word_set = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'bird']
